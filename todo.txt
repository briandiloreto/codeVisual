# TODO:

- Rewrite (in Typescript) or improve Crabviz dot generator code (in Rust):
    - Fix issue with not showing funtion calls from anonymous functions
    - Handle expand/collapse of nodes by updating the DOT appropriately

- Use d3-graphviz to generate SVG from dot and animate changes
- Add buttons as children of SVG elements to handle expand/collapse and hide/show  of nodes, and create functions to handle these interactions
- Ability to show call-chains to requested depth
- Ability to show variables alongside of functions/methods in a file
- Ability to highlight referencess of a variable
- Add interactions with code base:
    - Jump to symbol definition/declaration
    - Graph is panned/zoom automatically and nodes are highlighted to follow editor actions

- Maintain json files for each graph to describe expansion state and hidden variables/functions, etc
- Graph description files should indicate a priority, to indicate which graph to use when highlighting editor actions
